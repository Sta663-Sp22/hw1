    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently the word game [WORDLE](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) has seemed to take over the world, or at least twitter. Your task here is to come up with a Wordle puzzle solver in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with the game, a basic description follows: you will be presented with an unknown/secret 5 letter word - your goal is to guess that word with at most 6 guesses. Each time you guess the game will report back whether each of the guessed letters occurs in the secret word either in exactly that position (ðŸŸ©) or in someother position (ðŸŸ¨), or if it does not occur in any position in the secret word (â¬œ).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented a basic Wordle game in Python which you can play by importing the `worldle` module, which contains the `puzzle` class."

    "\n",
    "The following question is derived from a task given as part of this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). We are presenting a simplified version here for you to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task you will be given a matrix which is composed of the character values: \".\", \">\", and \"v\" and represents the current state of an evolving system. Your goal is to write a function that will iterate this system one step at a time using a specific set of rules until the system reaches steady state (i.e. the state does not change between the previous step and the current step) and report the number of steps required to reach this point. The following rules are used to iterate the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "* '.' elements are considered empty\n",
    "\n",
    "* '>' elements will move to their right if that position is empty, their current position becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'v' elements will move down if that position is empty, their current position becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elements that move off the right or bottom of the matrix wrap around to the left or top position respectively. These wrapped positions are considered for the purpose of deciding if a move is made or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each step occurs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * First all of the '>' elements' moves are considered simultaneously, so an element cannot move into a position being freed up by another '>' moving. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Second all of the 'v' elements' moves are considerted simultaneously, again elements cannot move into a position being freed up by another 'v' moving. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider a single row with elements `.>>..`, it will iterate as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. `.>>..` - Initial state\n",
    "1. `.>.>.` - Step 1, only the rightmost `>` moves\n",
    "2. `..>.>` - Step 2, both `>` may now move\n",
    "3. `>..>.` - Step 3, both `>` move, rightmost wraps to the left side\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent module has been provided which contains a `small` (9 x 10) and `large` (137 x 139) system, these data are stored as a list of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** - when working with the state object you will need to make a copy (at one or more points) in your code. Because the state object is a list a lists it is not sufficient to use the `copy()` method, instead you should use the `deepcopy()` function from the `copy` library.\n"
